      <description>Background SQL injection sucks, right? I&amp;rsquo;m not going to talk about it too much because firstly you already know, and secondly you can go somewhere else for a much better explanation.
# This is vulnerable to an SQL injection attack cursor.execute(f&amp;quot;SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = {id}&amp;quot;) # This is not, but it is much less natural cursor.execute(&amp;quot;SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = ?&amp;quot;, id) What I am going to talk about though is a neat idea I had after noticing a set of functions in EF Core: ExecuteSqlInterpolated and FromSqlInterpolated.</description>

      <description>This is the first blog post&amp;hellip; yay!
For a while I&amp;rsquo;ve had the ambition that I should try my hand at writing a blog, so this is me finally getting around to it.
I don&amp;rsquo;t expect to update often, but who knows.</description>
