      <description>What is an allRGB image? I first encountered the concept when I stumbled across allrgb.com.
 The objective of allRGB is simple: To create images with one pixel for every RGB color (16,777,216); not one color missing, and not one color twice.  As I assume would be the case for most developers, after the idea was presented to me I started to contemplate how I might go about transforming an image such that it meets that criteria but remains recognizable.</description>

      <description>Background    Don&#39;t use any code I provide or link to in production without giving it a serious think.   SQL injection sucks, right? I&amp;rsquo;m not going to talk about it too much because firstly you already know, and secondly you can go somewhere else for a much better explanation.
# This is vulnerable to an SQL injection attack cursor.execute(f&amp;quot;SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = {id}&amp;quot;) # This is not, but it is much less natural cursor.</description>
