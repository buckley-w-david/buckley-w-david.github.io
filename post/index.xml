      <description>Running arbitrary untrusted code is a bad idea, use your head.   You can find the source for stacksort here.
Background This project was inspired by the XKCD comic Ineffective Sorts and the similar project by Gregory Koberger, stacksort.
 StackSort connects to StackOverflow, searches for &amp;lsquo;sort a list&amp;rsquo;, and downloads and runs code snippets until the list is sorted. &amp;mdash; Randall Munroe  I wanted to be able to run download and run code from StackOverflow the same way I would use any normal Python package.</description>

      <title>String Interpolation and SQL</title>

      <description>Background    Don&#39;t use any code I provide or link to in production without giving it a serious think.   SQL injection sucks, right? I&amp;rsquo;m not going to talk about it too much because firstly you already know, and secondly you can go somewhere else for a much better explanation.
# This is vulnerable to an SQL injection attack cursor.execute(f&amp;quot;SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = {id}&amp;quot;) # This is not, but it is much less natural cursor.</description>

      <description>This is the first blog post&amp;hellip; yay!
For a while I&amp;rsquo;ve had the ambition that I should try my hand at writing a blog, so this is me finally getting around to it.
I don&amp;rsquo;t expect to update often, but who knows.</description>
